<p><b>ShinyEvents</b> is a web-based analytical framework designed for the exploration and visualization of complex longitudinal clinical data. It enables users to upload structured datasets and generate interactive timelines that trace individual patient trajectories. At the cohort level, ShinyEvents supports treatment clustering, endpoint annotation, and the generation of intuitive visual summaries, including Sankey diagrams of treatment sequences and Swimmer plots of clinical timelines. The platform also offers integrated survival analysis tools, allowing users to infer real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) based on custom-defined clinical endpoints and perform Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox proportional hazards modeling. By linking treatment lines with patient outcomes, ShinyEvents empowers real-time, multilayered longitudinal data analysis to support clinical research and decision-making.</p>
